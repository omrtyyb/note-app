# Node Note App

Started Node with [Andrew Mead](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2/#instructor-1), this is the first node project we have done so far.
It is a simple node project where you can save, read and remove notes from command line.






## Deployment

To write a note go to project directory and type

```bash
  node app.js add --title='The Title' --body='The body....'
```

To read from the notes you have to know the title to read the body of the note

```bash
  node app.js read --title='The Title'
```

To remove from the notes you have to know the title to remove the body of the note
```bash
  node app.js rm --title='The Title'
```
